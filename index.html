											<h2></h2>
										</header>
										<p>Immersed in the intersection of analytics and strategic pricing, I maintain an avid interest in building machine learning models. I am currently broadening my horizons as a student at Columbia University, engaged in an MSc in Applied Analytics. Before my academic venture, I gained valuable industry experience at L'Oréal, playing a pivotal role in the pricing and revenue optimization. 
											In the ever-evolving realm of machine learning, I mirror its adaptability and resilience. My specific niche in pricing doesn't limit my capability; rather, it forms a foundation from which I can branch out to tackle diverse challenges across multiple fields. 
											</p>
											<br>
            							<p>Of Indonesian origin and nationality, I've also spent significant parts of my life residing in Australia and the UK. Outside of my professional and educational pursuits, I'm known to be a force to be reckoned with when I'm hungry. My scant leisure time is usually spent appreciating the great outdoors, immersing myself in books and grooving to funk music. 
										    Additionally, I'm a student of bouldering and a fervent enthusiast of circuit training workouts.
